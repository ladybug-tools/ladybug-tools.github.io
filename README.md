_Making environmental design knowledge and tools freely accessible to every person, project and design process._

Ladybug Tools is a collection of free computer applications that support environmental design and education.
Of all the available environmental design software packages, Ladybug Tools is among the most comprehensive, connecting 3D Computer-Aided Design (CAD) interfaces to a host of validated simulation engines.

## VALIDATED
Ladybug Tools is built on top of several validated simulation engines: Radiance, EnergyPlus/ OpenStudio, Therm/ Window and OpenFOAM.

## FREE + OPEN SOURCE
Ladybug Tools is the only open source interface that unites all of its underlying open source engines. Like these engines, it evolves through the consensus of an open community of experts.

## COMMUNITY-SUPPORTED
Ladybug Tools is supported by a passionate and diverse community from around the world. Visit our online forum to see the discussions that shape our future development.

## 100K+ DOWNLOADS
Ladybug Tools has been downloaded more than 100,000 times and is the 3rd most popular plugin for Grasshopper. It's also the winner of the DynaAwards for best Dynamo analysis package.

## INTEGRATED
Ladybug Tools runs within 3D modeling software and allows data transfer between its simulation engines. So all geometry creation, simulation, and visualization happen within one interface.

## FLEXIBILE
Ladybug Tools is composed of modular components, making it flexible across different stages of design and capable of answering a variety of research questions.

## PARAMETRIC
Ladybug Tools runs within parametric visual scripting interfaces, enabling the exploration of design spaces and the automation of tasks.

## VISUAL
By harnessing capabilities of CAD interfaces, Ladybug Tools produces a variety of interactive 3D graphics, animations, and data visualizations.


## CROSS-PLATFORM
Ladybug Tools is written in Python, which can be run on virtually any operating system and plugged into any geometry engine (provided the geometry library is translated).

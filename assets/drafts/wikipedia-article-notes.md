Action Items
* Theo:Do we have a deadline in mind? My guess is that it will take at least two or three weeks befor I would be happy to present the article to somebody who could submit the article (and we need to find that person too ).
* Theo: Once there are the SVG logos in the assets/imag folder, I will get them into the Commons.

<details><summary><h2 style=display:inline; > General Arrangement of Wikipedia Articles</h2></summary>

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Layout

* This section describes the general layout of a wikipedia article
* There are very standard names for the part and a standard order
* The following headings follow the Wikipedia guidelines
* We would do well to follow these guidelines



## Before the lead section

### Infoboxes

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Infoboxes

A must have

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_infoboxes
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Infobox_software
* Infobox dot-com company
* Infobox organization


~~Looks like infobox software template is the way to go~~

## Body


### Lead Section

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Lead_section


### Table of contents (TOC)

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Section#Table_of_contents_(TOC)


### Content

2018-11-03 ~ Theo: My next task is to look at software articles that I respect and begin to list the sections that are used frequently

#### History

* History is just about always the first section in Content



## Standard Appendices
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Layout


### Works or Publications

Contents: A bulleted list, usually ordered chronologically, of the works created by the subject of the article.


### "See also"

Contents: A bulleted list of internal links to related Wikipedia articles.

### Notes


### External Links

Contents: A bulleted list of recommended relevant websites, each accompanied by a short description. These hyperlinks should not appear in the article's body text, nor should links used as references normally be duplicated in this section. "External links" should be plural, even if it lists only a single item.[8] This section may be replaced by a "Further reading" section.

### Further reading

Contents: An optional bulleted list, usually alphabetized, of a reasonable number of publications that would help interested readers learn more about the article subject.

## Five Pillars

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars

* Wikipedia is an encyclopedia
* Wikipedia is written from a neutral point of view
* Wikipedia is free content that anyone can use, edit, and distribute
* Wikipedia's editors should treat each other with respect and civility
* Wikipedia has no firm rules

## Rules

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Simplified_ruleset


## Notability

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability
* On Wikipedia, notability is a test used by editors to decide whether a given topic warrants its own article.
*  Wikipedia's concept of notability applies this basic standard to avoid indiscriminate inclusion of topics. Article and list topics must be notable, or "worthy of notice". Determining notability does not necessarily depend on things such as fame, importance, or popularity—although those may enhance the acceptability of a subject that meets the guidelines explained below.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_notability_guidelines

Ladybug Tools - Wikipedia Article Notes

### 2018-11-04 ~ Theo

* Add details tags to the major sections of the document

When I started thinking about this project what I has in mind was an article about a library or framework.
Well, that does not really seem to be a thing in Wikipedia.
Writing about Ladybug Tools as a single app seems not to work as well.
So my current thinking is to write about LT as a FOSS organization.



### 2018-11-03 ~ Theo

* Reorganize the sections
* Add more links

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Draft:Ladybug_Tools
* Add data to Infobox
* Add logo image to infobox

Action Items
* 2018-11-10 ~ Theo ~ need to agree sections headings. See 'Suggested sections' in Considerations...
* 2018-11-09 ~ Theo ~ need to decide which type of Infobox we want. See below
* Theo: Do we have a deadline in mind? My guess is that it will take at least two or three weeks befor I would be happy to present the article to somebody who could submit the article (and we need to find that person too ).
* Theo: Once there are the SVG logos in the assets/imag folder, I will get them into the Commons.

<details><summary><h2 style=display:inline; > General Arrangement of Wikipedia Articles</h2></summary>

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Layout

* This section describes the general layout of a wikipedia article
* There are very standard names for the part and a standard order
* The following headings follow the Wikipedia guidelines
* We would do well to follow these guidelines



### Before the lead section

### Infoboxes

* See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Infoboxes
* An infobox is a must have. Infoboxes are tricky to prepare
* An infobox is a panel, usually in the top right of an article, next to the lead section (in the desktop version of Wikipedia), or at the end of the lead section of an article (in the mobile version), that summarizes key features of the page's subject. Infoboxes may also include an image, a map, or both.
* Wikipedia's infoboxes almost always use the template software feature. The templates have parameters; to work properly, the parameter values have to be specified when the template is inserted in the page. This allows each infobox to show information relevant to the article subject, while requiring only a minimal amount of coding within each article.

Types of infoboxes
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_infoboxes
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Organization_infobox_templates

Possible choices

* suggested types as of 2018-11-09

~~Looks like infobox software template is the way to go~~

## Body

* Articles longer than a stub are generally divided into sections, and sections over a certain length are generally divided into paragraphs; these divisions enhance the readability of the article. The names and orders of section headings are often determined by the relevant WikiProject, although articles should still follow good organizational and writing principles regarding sections and paragraphs.

### Lead Section

* See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Lead_section
* The lead section (also known as the lead or introduction) of a Wikipedia article is the section before the table of contents and the first heading. The lead serves as an introduction to the article and a summary of its most important contents. It is not a news-style lead or "lede" paragraph.
* The average Wikipedia visit is a few minutes.[1] The lead is the first thing most people will read on arriving at an article. It gives the basics in a nutshell and cultivates interest in reading on – though not by teasing the reader or hinting at what follows. It should be written in a clear, accessible style with a neutral point of view.


### Table of contents (TOC)

* See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Section#Table_of_contents_(TOC)
* For each page with at least four headings, a table of contents (TOC) is automatically generated...

### Content

* Articles longer than a stub are generally divided into sections, and sections over a certain length are generally divided into paragraphs; these divisions enhance the readability of the article. The names and orders of section headings are often determined by the relevant WikiProject, although articles should still follow good organizational and writing principles regarding sections and paragraphs.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Computer_science/Manual_of_style


2018-11-03 ~ Theo: My next task is to look at software articles that I respect and begin to list the sections that are used frequently



#### History

* History is just about always the first section in Content



## Standard Appendices
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Layout


### Works or Publications

Contents: A bulleted list, usually ordered chronologically, of the works created by the subject of the article.


### "See also"

Contents: A bulleted list of internal links to related Wikipedia articles.

### Notes


### External Links

Contents: A bulleted list of recommended relevant websites, each accompanied by a short description. These hyperlinks should not appear in the article's body text, nor should links used as references normally be duplicated in this section. "External links" should be plural, even if it lists only a single item.[8] This section may be replaced by a "Further reading" section.

### Further reading

Contents: An optional bulleted list, usually alphabetized, of a reasonable number of publications that would help interested readers learn more about the article subject.

### Five Pillars

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars

* Wikipedia is an encyclopedia
* Wikipedia is written from a neutral point of view
* Wikipedia is free content that anyone can use, edit, and distribute
* Wikipedia's editors should treat each other with respect and civility
* Wikipedia has no firm rules

### Rules

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Simplified_ruleset


### Notability

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability
* On Wikipedia, notability is a test used by editors to decide whether a given topic warrants its own article.
*  Wikipedia's concept of notability applies this basic standard to avoid indiscriminate inclusion of topics. Article and list topics must be notable, or "worthy of notice". Determining notability does not necessarily depend on things such as fame, importance, or popularity—although those may enhance the acceptability of a subject that meets the guidelines explained below.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_notability_guidelines

Ladybug Tools - Wikipedia Article Notes


### 2018-11-18 ~ Theo

* Add test to suggested sections

### 2018-11-10 ~ Theo

* Add to Infoboxes section
* Add to body section
* Websites standards...
	* Add organizations and their body section titles
	* Add 'suggested sections' section

### 2018-11-04 ~ Theo

* Add details tags to the major sections of the document

When I started thinking about this project what I has in mind was an article about a library or framework.
Well, that does not really seem to be a thing in Wikipedia.
Writing about Ladybug Tools as a single app seems not to work as well.
So my current thinking is to write about LT as a FOSS organization.



### 2018-11-03 ~ Theo

* Reorganize the sections
* Add more links

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Draft:Ladybug_Tools
* Add data to Infobox
* Add logo image to infobox

### 2018-10-26 ~ Theo

Ladybug Tools - Wikipedia Article Notes
* Add more text and links

# Spider
Spider is a collection of interactive 3D web applications to help with [building performance simulation]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_performance_simulation ) written in plain-vanilla JavaScript.


# What is Spider?

## Draft 2

Spider is a coding cookbook providing easy-to use and easy-to-customize free open source JavaScript source code. The over-arching intent is to facilitate the transfer of data between CAD and energy analysis programs via real-time 3D visualization. Tools - mostly built upon the Three.js WebGL library - are available to view, examine and edit data files. Currently the scripts - and accompanying sample file libraries - provide good support for gbXML files and Radiance software data files. Many of the coding samples were written is response to user queries. All code is hosted on GitHub and runnable in the browser by clicking the link in the content management scripts.

## Draft 1

The Spider gbXML Viewer scripts allow you to view, identify issues and modify industry standard gbXML files so that can transfer data from CAD programs to energy analysis applications quickly and easily and without errors. The gbXML files may be hundreds of megabytes in size and files contained in ZIP folders.

The Spider RAD Viewer scripts allow you to view RAD data files created for Radiance software.The data may be read from collections of separate files.

The Spider 3D Data Visualization scripts allow you to view large complex data sets with many variable in an interactive, filtering environment.

The various Spider Cookbook and Sandbox scripts allow you to peruse dozens of scripts - both successes and failures - that have been used to build or enhance the primary Spider applications.

The Spider sample file repositories provide you with building models that you can use to help you learn how to use the viewer scripts as well as to provide data for testing the various scripts.
